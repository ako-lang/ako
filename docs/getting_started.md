# Getting Started

## From NPM

```sh
# Install Ako interpreter
npm install -g ako-lang

# Execute
ako ./test.ako
```

## Standalone Executable

You can directly use standalone executable of the interpreter : [Release page](https://github.com/ako-lang/ako/releases)

It's compiled for **Windows**, **Mac** and **Linux** and once downloaded, you can use it to run Ako scripts
```sh
./ako.exe test.ako
```

## CDN

For web usage, you can load the library directly with ESM imports
```js
import * as Ako from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ako-lang@0.0.5/dist/web/ako-web.js'
```

## How to write Ako scripts ?

For that, please take a look at our [Documentation](https://ako-lang.github.io/ako/index.html#/./docs/grammar_basic)
